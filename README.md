Welcome to CLoaKY's GitHub Profile! 🚀
Hey there! 👋 I'm Lay Sheth, also known as CLoaKY. I'm passionate about diving deep into the realms of Machine Learning and crafting innovative applications. This is where my coding adventures unfold, and I'm excited to share them with you.

About Me
👋 Hi, I’m Lay Sheth, Aka CLoaKY!
👀 I’m interested in Machine learning and application development.
🌱 I’m currently learning ML and Deep learning, while also working on some projects for my college, including digitalizing the old project exhibition system!
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Projects that include Python and machine learning.
📫 Please contact me on laysheth1@gmail.com, I'll be looking forward to hearing from you!!
⚡ Fun fact: Python is as vivid as one can ever imagine but its capabilities are limited due to one's slow approach.
Projects
Here are some of the big projects you'll find in my GitHub:
    1. Login authentication using python without imports, with offline/json logging features!
    2. Medicine/Drug classification using decision trees algorithm in python!
College Project Exhibition System: Digitalizing the old project exhibition system to streamline showcasing and enhance accessibility.
More projects coming soon! Stay tuned for updates.
